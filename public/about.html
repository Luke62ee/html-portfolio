<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  As a Computer Science student at the University of Washington, I specialize in
  blending core software engineering principles with front-end development to
  create seamless user experiences. With a GPA of 3.7/4.0 and a spot on the
  Dean's list, my academic rigor is matched by practical skills in Python, Java,
  C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My projects, ranging from enhancing Netflix's
  customer interface to developing a comprehensive banking application, showcase
  my ability to not only code but also improve user engagement through intuitive
  design.
</p>

<p>
  My proficiency extends beyond programming languages; I'm adept with tools like
  Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and methodologies like Agile to deliver projects
  that excel in both functionality and aesthetics. As a Student Activity
  Coordinator/Ambassador at Bellevue College, I've developed strong
  interpersonal skills, enabling me to lead with empathy and communicate
  effectively across diverse groups.
</p>
<p>
  I am driven by the potential of technology to address real-world challenges,
  and I am eager to contribute to projects that prioritize innovation, user
  experience, and impactful results.
